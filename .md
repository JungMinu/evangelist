### Node.js v4.2.1 (LTS) and v4.2.0 (LTS) Releases

This week we have two releases: [Node.js v4.2.1](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v4.2.1/) and [Node.js v4.2.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v4.2.0/). complete changelog from previous releases can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Notable changes

* Includes fixes for two regressions
  - Assertion error in WeakCallback  - see [#3329](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/3329)
  - Undefined timeout regression - see [#3331](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/3331)

### Known issues

* When a server queues a large amount of data to send to a client over a pipelined HTTP connection, the underlying socket may be destroyed. See [#3332](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/3332) and [#3342](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/3342).
* Some problems with unreferenced timers running during `beforeExit` are still to be resolved. See [#1264](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1264).
* Surrogate pair in REPL can freeze terminal. [#690](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/690)
* Calling `dns.setServers()` while a DNS query is in progress can cause the process to crash on a failed assertion. [#894](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/894)
* `url.resolve` may transfer the auth portion of the url when resolving between two full hosts, see [#1435](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1435).

### Node.js Foundation Welcomes Red Hat as Newest Platinum Member

* The Node.js Foundation, a community-led and industry-backed consortium to advance the development of the Node.js platform, announced Red Hat, Inc. has joined the Foundation as a Platinum member. 
* Red Hat joins platinum members, including Famous, IBM, Intel, Joyent, Microsoft and PayPal, to provide support in the adoption, development and long-term success of the Node.js project.
